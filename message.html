                        Happy Valentine's Day to my Disney Princess na friend!! Thank you for always listening to my random yapping and my vents even though you don't know how to comfort me. HAHAHA!!

                    <p>
                        Sorry kasi di kita mabigyan ng physical letter but this is the farthest I can get HAHAHAHAHA
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sana we can play together again sa MC or Roblox. I really miss playing with you and the people sa crib. I'm just a little shy kasi. ^^'

                        I hope you're still the fun, bubbly, and OA Suni I know despite all the hate you received. You deserve all the love in the world! ❤️
